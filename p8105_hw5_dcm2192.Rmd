### Problem 1


### Problem 2

Define function.
```{r}
sim_mean_sd <- function(mu, n = 30, sigma = 5) {
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
  )
  sim_data |> 
    t.test() |> 
    broom::tidy() |> 
    summarize(
      mu_hat = estimate, 
      p_value = p.value
    )
}
```

Datasets with mu 0-6.
```{r}
sim_results_df <- 
  expand_grid(
    mu = c(0:6),
    iter = 1:5000
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    estimate_df = map(mu, sim_mean_sd)
  ) |> 
  unnest(estimate_df)
```

Plot mu 0-6 where null was rejected. 
```{r}
sim_results_df |> 
  filter(p_value <= 0.05) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = mu)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  labs(x = "True value of mu", y = "Proportion of times null was rejected (Power)")
```

The relationship between effect size and power is such that the number of times the null is rejected increases as the true value of mu increases.
